Explanation:
-------------
The program prompts the user to enter the basic salary and the number of overtime hours.

It calculates the allowance based on the overtime hours:

Overtime hours ≥ 30: 20% of the basic salary.

20 ≤ Overtime hours < 30: 10% of the basic salary.

10 ≤ Overtime hours < 20: 5% of the basic salary.

Overtime hours < 10: No allowance.

The net salary is calculated as: Net Salary = Basic Salary + Allowance.

Finally, the program displays the calculated net salary.
